# Logistic Regression Model for Diagnosis Prediction ðŸ©ºðŸ“Š

This project builds a logistic regression model to predict the diagnosis of a medical condition (potentially cancer) based on various diagnostic features. The dataset used contains multiple features related to patient diagnostics, and the task is to classify each diagnosis as malignant (M) or benign (B).

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset by removing unnecessary columns and handling missing data.
- **Feature Scaling**: Apply standard scaling to the feature set to normalize the data.
- **Logistic Regression**: Use logistic regression to train the model.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to find the best performing model.
- **Model Persistence**: Save the trained model and scaler for future use.

## Tech Stack ðŸ’»

- **Python**: Programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building the machine learning model and preprocessing the data.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading the trained model and scaler.
